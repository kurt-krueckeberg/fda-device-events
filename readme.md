# OpenFDA Adverse Event Fetcher

Will use PHP and Guzzle REST Client

## Example Apps

OpenFDA [Apps](https://open.fda.gov/community/).

These Apps seem to be functioning:

- [Open Vigil FDA](https://openvigil.pharmacology.uni-kiel.de/openvigilfda.php) 

Q: Which fields from devie-api-field.yanl are returned?

- [Avdverse Veterinary Events](https://adversevetevents.com/search/).
